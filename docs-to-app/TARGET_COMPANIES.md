## Email Templates

### Template 1: For DevRel Leads (Pain-Focused)

```
Subject: Cut API onboarding time by 90%

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] has comprehensive API docs, but I bet you still
see developers getting stuck on authentication and first integration.

Quick question: What's your current time-to-first-API-call metric?

We built a tool that turns OpenAPI specs into interactive playgrounds
where developers can test your API in their browser in under 5 minutes.
No SDK install, no auth debugging.

Early results from [similar company]:
- Time-to-first-call: 3.5 hours → 8 minutes
- Activation rate: +112%
- Support tickets: -60%

Can I show you a 5-minute demo using [Company's] actual API?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - We use Claude AI to auto-generate examples in 7 languages
from your OpenAPI spec.
```

### Template 2: For Founders (ROI-Focused)

```
Subject: [Company] + interactive API docs = 2x activation

Hi [Name],

Love what you're building with [Company].

I'm working on something that might help with developer onboarding:
We turn API documentation into interactive playgrounds.

Instead of:
1. Read docs → 2. Install SDK → 3. Debug auth → 4. First call

It's:
1. Click "Try API" → 2. First successful call in browser

Built specifically for fast-growing API companies like [Company].

Would you be open to a 10-minute call to see if it fits?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### Template 3: For Technical Decision-Makers

```
Subject: OpenAPI spec → Interactive playground (automated)

Hi [Name],

Quick pitch: We auto-generate interactive API playgrounds from
OpenAPI specs using Claude AI.

Input: Your openapi.json
Output: Full testing interface with:
- Pre-configured auth
- Multi-language examples
- Live request/response
- Embeddable in your docs

Tech: FastAPI backend, React frontend, Claude Sonnet 4.5

Would love to show you what we built using [Company's] API as an
example. 15 minutes?

Cheers,
[Your Name]

GitHub: [link if you have it]
